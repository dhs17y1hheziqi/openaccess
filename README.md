## Versant Open Access JDO 4.0.2

Versant Open Access JDO is a Java Data Objects (JDO) implementation for relational databases and Versant ODBMS focussing on performance, flexible mapping, optimistic transactions and distributed PersistenceManagers. It implements version 1.0.1 of the JDO specification.

JDO provides for easy, transparent access to persistent data via a neutral query syntax. Developers using JDO do not have to write any JDBC code or SQL queries. Objects are persisted and queried through a PersistenceManager implementation provided by the JDO vendor. Classes are mapped to the physical store using JDO meta data. This mapping may be changed without changing the application classes making it easy to support different databases and schemas.
